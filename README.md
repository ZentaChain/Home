## Zentachain

Zentachain is largely based and focused on communication. Zentachain uses ultra-secure encryption of data and communication on which multiple encryptions are applied. Zentachain knows that the time has come to communicate in a strong range offline to offline. Zentachain is exactly the opposite of today's communications and applications while you pay for free applications with your data and information. Zentachain rewards the users who support Zentameshnet with Zenta by running a Zentanode.

Zentachain enables users to communicate and store data with Zentalk and Zentavault within the ecosystem. All the running decentralized Apps will be anonymous and secure. There will be no record of users or linked transactions to prove and demonstrate the capabilities of Zentachain. Team introduces a decentralized ultra-secure messenger. More information can be found into the Whitepaper.

## Zentanetwork
Zentanetwork is a forkless Proof of Stake blockchain for communication and data storage.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encrypted, decentralized and peer-to-peer messenger. Next to great usability, under the hood, youâ€™ll find state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security. Zentalk is decentralized, it has no server point. Zentachain guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between the sender and receiver using Zentanodes, inclusive hashing function Blake2, and the TOR-network.

## Zentavault

Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vault (encrypted storage) and transfer service. Unlike regular data storage systems, Zentavault will store nothing on the user's device. Zentavault acts as an encryption delivery tool, with the ability to encrypt and dynamically distribute content securely onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository.
