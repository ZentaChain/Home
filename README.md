## Zentachain

Zentachain is a privacy-based project that focuses on communication and data storage, one of the most important issues of our day. The ecosystem is supported by its users and takes every precaution against various types of cyberattacks or hacking. Zentachain offers safe, fast, cheap, and applicable original solutions to the problems it focuses on. Zentachain is an open-source project and aims to bridge the gap between decentralized meshnetwork cloud services such as IPFS (https://ipfs.io) and dynamic routing and addressing protocols such as DNS and HTTPS.

Zentachain provides the ability to address large amounts of data with IPFS and place non-modifiable, persistent IPFS connections in the Zentanetwork using a blockchain transaction. This timestamp and secures content without having to put the data into Zentanetwork itself. Zentachain has established an ecosystem that will save users significant money and information.

Zentachain is fast, secure, and flexible access to data without any delay. Zentachain is a decentralized system and its ecosystem is designed in such a way that it never tracks the users and does not store or save any data. In order to use many Messenger applications, important personal data is requested from the users and as a result, many serious problems arise, to avoid all these problems, we have provided our users with the convenience of using Zentalk without requesting any information.

Zentachain encourages users to support the Zentanetwork and increases security by rewarding users who support Zentanetwork with their cryptocurrency Zenta ($CHAIN). The purpose of Zentachain is to provide people and companies a way to stay safe without fear of eavesdropping, spying, or getting their data. The decentralized Offline Zentalk App has quantum resistance with multiple cryptography encryptions.

## Zentanetwork
Zentanetwork is a forkless Proof of Stake network  for communication and data storage.

## Zentalk

Zentalk is a highly secure hybrid encrypted, decentralized and peer-to-peer messenger. Next to great usability, under the hood, youâ€™ll find state-of-the-art encryption with AES-256, Diffie-Helman, RSA and El-Gamal security. Zentalk is decentralized, it has no server point. Zentachain guarantees full anonymity and offline communication between the sender and receiver using Zentanodes, inclusive hashing function Blake2, and the TOR-network.

## Zentavault

Zentavault is a high-throughput encrypted and distributed file vault (encrypted storage) and transfer service. Unlike regular data storage systems, Zentavault will store nothing on the user's device. Zentavault acts as an encryption delivery tool, with the ability to encrypt and dynamically distribute content securely onto the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository.
